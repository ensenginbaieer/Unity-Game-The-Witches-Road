# Unity Game: The Witches' Road
This is the final project for the course **CSYE7270: Building Virtual Environments** at **Northeastern University**. Currently it is still unfinished, as there are many functions and game contents I would like to implement that have not yet been realized.

**This is just my personal project, and any future updates or the final product will remain as a personal project without any commercial use.**

## Inspiration
**Gaming Style**: _**Darkest Dungeon**_<br/>
**Story**: _**Agatha All Along**_ (Marvel's TV show)<br/>
